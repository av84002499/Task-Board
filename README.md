## Requirements

* Uses React, and no jQuery
* Uses modular components
* Uses axios and/or Firebase
* React 'knows' about all DOM changes
* this.state is never directly changed because .setState() is always used to alter state
* App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop-down menu, search field)
* It is clear to the user what the app does
* App and interactions are accessible
* Errors are handled effectively

## Known Issues

* Some versions of Safari and Firefox do not handle the onBlur event of the task form as designed, resulting in users not being able to add, update, and delete tasks
  * **Current workarounds:**
    * Use Google Chrome
    * Use the `tab` and `return` keys to interact with the form
